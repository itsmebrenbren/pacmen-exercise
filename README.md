# pacmen-exercise
MIT XPRO exercise that generates pacmen

***

## Description
This repo was created as part of the MITxPro course.

This repo generates pacmen on a click of a button, and then on clicking "make faster" the pacmen move about the screen.

## How to Run
Project may be loaded in a browser locally. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I would like to add more images so that there are pacmen, ghosts, and fruits and thing flying around the screen too.
I would like the new ghosts to eat the pacmen when they touch.
It would also be nice to have the pacmen eat the fruit.
